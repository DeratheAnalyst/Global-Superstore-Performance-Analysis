## Skills & Tools Demonstrated (Power BI)

Power Query: Used for connecting to the data source, extracting necessary information, and performing the initial transformation and cleaning processes.

Data Modeling: Involved in creating relationships between multiple tables to build a coherent and analyzable data model.

Data Cleaning: Essential steps were taken to handle missing values, standardize formats  and ensure data quality and consistency for accurate analysis.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated columns and measures such as Total Profit, Total Sales, Average Shipping Cost.

Data Visualization:  Designed interactive charts, maps, tables, KPI cards , and bookmarks  to present complex data.

## Analysis & Findings 

### Top Profitable Countries and Products (2014)

a) The three most profitable countries in 2014 were the United States ($94K), India ($49K), and China ($47K).

b) Top 3 products per Country 
-	United States: Top products were Canon ImageCLASS ($15.68K), GSC DocuBind Binding System ($1.91K), and HP LaserJet Copier ($3.62K).
  
-	India:  Top products were Cisco Smart Phone ($1.61K), Hamilton Beach Refrigerator ($1.44K), and Sauder Classic Bookcase ($2.42K).

### Most Valuable Customers

The most valuable customers are identified not just by sales volume but by the profit they generate. The top 10 customers by profit are listed, with  Tamara Chand being the most profitable customer ($8,672.90).

### Global overview 

Sales by Country was visualized using a map. Countries with the highest sales can be spotted by their bigger bubbles.

### Performance overview 

The ribbon chart displays sales and profit growth from the year 2011 to 2014. The chart shows a significant growth in sales and profit along the years.

### High Shipping Cost Sub-Categories (USA)

The three sub-categories with the highest average shipping costs in the USA are Tablets ($93), Copiers ($72) and Bookcases ($64). These high costs are likely due to their size, weight, and/or special handling requirements.

### Least Profitable US City

The least profitable city in the United States (with more than 10 orders) is Concord. The dashboard indicates it generated a significant loss ( -$1,862).

### Nigeria’s Performance in Africa (2014)

a) Nigeria’s profitability in 2014 was significantly poor, especially when compared to other African nations like South Africa, which showed a much stronger performance.

b) Two primary factors are responsible:
-	Excessive Discounting: Nigeria has the highest average discount rate among all countries analyzed at a staggering  96.51%. This severely erodes profit margins.
  
-	Customer Segment Mix: Sales in Nigeria are dominated by the Consumer segment ($9.1K), which is typically more price-sensitive and may receive more promotions compared to the more profitable Corporate segment ($5.0K).

### Least Profitable Sub-Category and where to shop offering in Southeast Asia
a) The least profitable product sub-category in Southeast Asia is Tables.

b) Singapore is a specific country where offering Tables is particularly unprofitable and should be reconsidered. The losses in Singapore for this sub-category are notably high compared to other Southeast Asian countries.

### Highest Average Profit Sub-Category (Australia)

The product sub-category with the highest average profit in Australia is appliances. Spotting an average profit higher than $100.


## Recommendations

Optimize Shipping Logistics: Investigate the high shipping costs for Tables, Copiers, and Bookcases in the US. Negotiate with carriers, optimize packaging, or consider implementing a shipping surcharge for these items to protect margins.

Revise Nigeria’s Strategy: Immediately review and drastically reduce the discount strategy in Nigeria. Focus on promoting higher-margin products to the Corporate segment instead of competing on price with the Consumer segment.

Product Portfolio Management: Consider ceasing the sale of Tables in Singapore due to consistent unprofitability. Alternatively, investigate the root cause (e.g., shipping, supplier costs) before making a final decision.

City Level Analysis: Conduct a deep-dive analysis into Concord’s operations to understand the cause of its losses. This could involve analyzing order-level data for returns, discounts, and shipping costs.

Leverage Top Customers: Launch a targeted loyalty or VIP program for top profitable customers like Tamara Chand and Raymond Buch. Analyze their purchasing patterns and recommend similar high margin products to increase customer lifetime value.


## Conclusion
The Global Superstore Performance Dashboard successfully transforms complex transactional data into a clear strategic asset. 

The analysis reveals significant opportunities to improve profitability by addressing regional pricing strategies, optimizing logistics costs, and making data-driven decisions about product offerings in specific markets. 

By implementing the recommended actions, Global Superstore can shift from a broad, undifferentiated strategy to a targeted, profit-optimized approach, ensuring sustainable growth and improved financial performance.
